  // IMPORTANT NOTE: In a production application, facial biometric data should be:
  // 1. Processed with specialized libraries like FaceTec, AWS Rekognition, or open source alternatives
  // 2. Secured with proper encryption

  // 4. Enhanced with liveness detection to prevent spoofing
  // 5. Stored as templates, not raw images
  // 6. Processed on device when possible or via secure channels

# DIS_backend - Authentication Module

## Overview
The `DIS_backend` directory contains the backend implementation for a passwordless authentication system integrated into the `CPS5007-Team-6` project. This module leverages the Radix Connect API (simulated here) to provide secure authentication using cryptographic signatures. It is built with FastAPI and includes routes, service logic, and data models to support the authentication workflow.

## Purpose
This module enables:
- Generation of random challenges for authentication.
- Verification of user signatures using public keys.
- A structured approach to backend development within the team's repository.
